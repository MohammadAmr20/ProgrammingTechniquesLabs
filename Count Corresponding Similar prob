1- Write a function CountSimilar that takes two arrays of the same size 5 and performs the following:

outputs an array of booleans of the same size which contains true is the two corresponding elements are similar, false if not

outputs the count of elements that are at the same index in the two arrays AND contain equal values

returns true if all the corresponding elements are similar (the two arrays are identical), false otherwise

Write a program that:

a. Creates two arrays of size 5 elements

b. Reads the values of the 5 elements of the first array from the user

c. Reads the values of the 5 elements of the second array from the user

d. Calls the function CountSimilar with the two arrays and prints the elements of the output boolean array, the count of the corresponding similar, a message "identical" or "not identical".

Input Format

one line containing 5 integers for the first array
one line containing 5 integers for the second array
Constraints

no constraints
Output Format

one line containing the boolean array elements space separated
one line containing the count of corresponding similar
one line containing "identical" or "not identical"
Sample Input 0

1 3 2 6 8
1 2 3 6 7
Sample Output 0

1 0 0 1 0
2
not identical
