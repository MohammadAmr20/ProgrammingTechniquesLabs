Write a function Reverse that takes an array as a pointer and array size

• The function reverses the array in place (i.e. without allocating extra array)

• If the array is symmetric, the function should not reverse the array and just returns false

Write a program ( the “main” function) that:

a. Creates a local array of size 7.

b. Reads 7 integer numbers from the user and stores them in the array

c. Calls the function Reverse with the required parameters then print array is "symmetric" or "not symmetric" and also prints array after reverse

Input Format

one line containing the 7 integers separated by space
Constraints

array values are any integer values
Output Format

one line containing "symmetric" or "not symmetric"
one line containing the 7 array elements separated by space
Sample Input 0

1 4 5 5 5 4 1
Sample Output 0

symmetric
1 4 5 5 5 4 1
