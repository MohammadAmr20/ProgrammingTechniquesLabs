Write a function CountOccurrence that takes an integer array and a non-negative integer X, and outputs the number of occurrence of X, -X, and the divisibles by X in the array. The function should also return false if the three counts are zeros.

Write a program that:

a. Creates an array of size 6 elements

b. Reads the values of the 6 elements from the user

c. Read X from the user

d. Calls the function CountOccurrence with the required parameters and prints the three counts and a message indicating whether all counts are zeros.

Input Format

the first line containing 6 integers separated by space
the second line containing X
Constraints

the values of the elements could be any integer value
X is a non-negative integer
Output Format

the first line contains the sentence "all zeros" or "not all zeros" (depending or the returned boolean).
the second line contains the 3 counts (X, -X, the divisibles by X) separated by a space.
Sample Input 0

3 6 -3 -5 3 4
3
Sample Output 0

not all zeros
2 1 4
